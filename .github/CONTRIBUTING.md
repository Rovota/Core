# Contribution Guide

Good to hear you have interest in contributing! We greatly appreciate help from the community in making our products and services better and better. 

This guide should help you understand exactly how we expect contributions to be me, and what you can expect from us. Any contributions, discussions and other submissions are subject to our [Code of Conduct](https://rovota.com/legal/code-of-conduct).

## Pull Requests

The preferred way is to contribute through pull requests, which encourages collaboration and allows us to iterate and pass new functionality and/or changes faster.

Pull requests will only be reviewed by our team when they are marked as ready and should include a proper description/summary of changes made. Pull requests that are marked as draft for a period of two weeks, will be disregarded and closed.

## Bug Reports

We understand that not everyone is comfortable fixing the issues themselves and subsequently creating a pull request for us to look at. In that case, feel free to file a bug report with as much detail as possible.

Each bug report should have the following information at minimum:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- The version(s) of the software affected.
- Version information for related software used if applicable (e.g. PHP, Nginx, MySQL).
- A description of the functionality that does not work/appear as it should.
- How it should work/appear instead.

The way a bug reports needs to be filed varies. For open source projects, these should be created on the issue tracker of the relevant GitHub repository. For all other projects/products, bug reports can be filed using our own feedback tool available within the product or account portal.

**Note**: We may not immediately respond to bug reports. This may be due to a busy schedule or because we need to investigate the reported issue before providing an appropriate response.

## Discussions & Ideas

Our community is vital to the future of our projects. Feel free to suggest new features or improvements to the issue tracker of the relevant GitHub repository you wish to contribute to.

To improve productivity and keep things manageable for our staff, we ask you to only send in feedback through the GitHub issue tracker for things that would benefit more people than just yourself. When in doubt, feel free to discuss it with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vsfVXB4) first.

## Branching

**All** bug fixes should be submitted to the latest stable branch of a given project. Never submit bug fixes to the **main** branches, unless they fix functionality that only exist in those branches.

**Minor** additions and/or changes that are fully backwards compatible with the current release should be sent to the latest stable branch.

**Major** additions and/or changes, often with breaking changes, must always be sent to the **main** branch of a project. These submissions may be included in the upcoming release.

## Code Style

All of our projects use the [PSR-12](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md) standard for code style and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) standard for autoloading.
