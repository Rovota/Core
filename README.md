## About Rovota Core

Rovota Core is a modern framework written in PHP designed to be reliable, fast and accessible. Combined with the use of the latest language features and modular architecture, you can add any functionality you might need in addition to those already available.

In fact, we are so confident in this framework, it has become the underlying platform on top of which we build most of our products and experiences. This also helps us to better test its usability and reliability, allowing us to provide updates accordingly.

## System Requirements

* PHP 8.1 or newer.
* MySQL 8+ with InnoDB, MariaDB 10.6+ or PostgreSQL 14+.

## Dependencies

While we try to keep the footprint to a minimum, various dependencies are used to improve functionality and speed up development when reasonably necessary.

Occasionally we may update the used dependencies and/or their minimum versions. Please check the `composer.json` file for up-to-date information on required and suggested dependencies and their version requirements.
